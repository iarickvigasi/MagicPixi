# Magic Pixi Test Task

This project is built using Webpack, Typescript and PixiJS!

I wanted to make this project interesting for devs to take a look, also enjoyable by myself while writing.

Live demo: https://softgames-fantasy-test.herokuapp.com/
### How to run?

```
$ npm i
$ npm serve
```

The dev server will be opened automatically at `localhost:8080`

### What are done?
<pre>
All 3 tasks are done.

1. 144 Magic Cards
Beautifully crafted pixel tarot cards are moving to other side like they are filled with some kind of GreenSock magick ;) 

2. Fantasy Texts
This was tough. Will you be able to decipher elvish?
Made by manually drawing with context text and image. 
This is really magic. I mean it. 

3. Fireballs
Well, not exactly. It is pixel fire! Made by pixi-particles. 6 sprites for fire, and 4 for smoke.
It is magically minimalistic! 
</pre>

### What can be better?
Oh, man. There is huge issue with resizing. It is far from adaptive.

Fireballs can be real fireballs. And they should run with blazing effects into walls, and crash them!

### Other
I really hope you like it :)
