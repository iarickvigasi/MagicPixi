# Magic Pixi Test Task

This project is built using Webpack, Typescript and PixiJS!

I wanted to make this project interesting for devs to take a look, also enjoyable by myself while writing.

### How to run?

```
$ npm i
$ npm serve
```

The dev server will be opened automatically at `localhost:8080`

### What are done?
<pre>
All 3 tasks are done.

1. 144 Magic Cards
Beautifully crafted pixel tarot cards are moving to other side like they are filled with some kind of GreenSock magick ;) 

2. Fantasy Texts
This was tough. Will you be able to decipher elvish?
Made by manually drawing with context text and image. 
This is really magic. I mean it. 

3. Fireballs
Well, not exactly. It is pixel fire! Made by pixi-particles. 6 sprites for fire, and 4 for smoke.
It is magically minimalistic!

### Other
I really hope you like it :)
